<body>
msjs is a simple system for generating XHTML pages with rich AJAX-style
functionality. msjs uses the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino
JavaScript interpreter</a> to execute both framework- and user-code.  As such,
much of the the msjs system is written in JavaScript. For more on the APIs
provided by the msjs JavaScript framework, refer to the <a
href="../jsdoc/index.html">msjs JavaScript documentation</a>.
